# Belong
This prototype was built during a 3-day Design Sprint where we explored the idea of connecting people passionate about social justice with volunteer opportunities. The clean, mobile-friendly web app allows users to browse volunteer opportunities at nearby organizations and either sign up to volunteer or contact the organization for more information.

More work needs to be done to determine the best way to maintain a database of volunteer opportunities, distribute the app to potential volunteers, and lower the bar to volunteering in social justice issues through awareness and educational initiatives.
